## Migrations for Gas Station Management System

This directory contains the migration files for the gas station management system's database. Migrations are used to manage changes to the database schema over time.

### How to Use Migrations

1. **Creating a Migration**: 
   To create a new migration, use the migration tool provided by your framework or ORM. This will generate a new migration file in this directory.

2. **Applying Migrations**: 
   To apply the migrations to your database, run the migration command. This will update the database schema according to the migration files.

3. **Rolling Back Migrations**: 
   If you need to revert a migration, use the rollback command. This will undo the last applied migration.

4. **Checking Migration Status**: 
   You can check the status of your migrations to see which ones have been applied and which are pending.

### Best Practices

- Always back up your database before applying new migrations.
- Review migration files before applying them to ensure they contain the expected changes.
- Keep your migration files organized and well-documented for future reference.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation of the migration tool you are using.
